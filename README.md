## Self-Reflection:
Each time I pushed a commit I just got a loading screen, unsure if they committed? I did multiple. I am still unsure about github so I honestly don't know if I "hosted on github pages". I didn't have any trouble with the assignment itself and enjoyed getting back into HTML/CSS. *UPDATE* I believe I have it hosted on github now...

### How long it took me to finish this?
About 4-5 hours, struggled trying to figure out how to/if I was able to host the page on github or not. Like I said I tried to do commits and recieved loading pages and no confirmation.
